# Base layout template with Gulp, SCSS and Stylelint
This is a browser-based 2048 game created using HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript, with DOM (Document Object Model) handling the interface updates.

Game Description
2048 is a puzzle game where the player moves numbered tiles on a 4×4 grid, merging identical values. The goal is to reach 2048. Each move shifts the tiles in one direction, and a new number (2 or 4) appears in a random empty cell. The game ends when there are no available moves or when a tile reaches 2048.

Technologies Used:
HTML — page structure and layout.
CSS (SCSS) — styling, animations, and tile colors.
JavaScript (ES6) — game logic, key press handling, and tile merging mechanics.
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) — the Game class organizes the logic.
DOM (Document Object Model) — updates the game board and UI dynamically.
Git — version control.
Features:
✔ Keyboard controls (WASD or arrow keys).
✔ Score tracking.
✔ Win/loss conditions.
✔ Restart button.
✔ Dynamic UI updates using DOM.
✔ Responsive layout and animations.

This 2048 game is built with modern web technologies, ensuring smooth interaction without page reloads.
